-- | This procedure is to workaround issues when install names of dependencies
--   point to symbolic links. Currently we just copy all actual dependencies
--   (and know their "real paths") but this might be not enough. For example:
--   @libicui18n.63.dylib@ depends on @libicudata.63.dylib@ and
--   @libicudata.63.dylib@ is a symlink to @libicudata.63.1.dylib@. We place
--   just @libicudata.63.1.dylib@ in the package and dyld will fail to find
--   @libicudata.63.dylib@.
--
--   This procedure looks for unresolved local libraries (ie. the library
--   install names that are not present next to installed binary, and tries to
--   patch the install name so it refers to the library name as placed in the
--   package. This affects only libraries with same name prefix (that is part of
--   name until first dot).
--
--   In the long-term this solution should be abandoned, dependencies should be
--   described by packages, just like binaries to install.
